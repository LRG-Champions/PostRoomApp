### Key features
* **Scanning app:** Can be used by the post team to scan post into the relevant pigeonhole 
* **Receiveing app:** Is used by all business users to receive post and can be emitted into Teams. In our setup we attach each pigeonhole to a Team so that permissions can be managed by the Team owner
